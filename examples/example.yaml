# Minimal srtctl job configuration template
# This example shows a disaggregated setup with 1 prefill node and 4 decode nodes

# Job name (used in logs directory and SLURM job name)
name: "example-job"

# Model configuration
model:
  path: "deepseek-r1"  # Alias from srtslurm.yaml or full path like "/models/deepseek-r1"
  container: "lmsysorg+sglang+v0.5.5.post2.sqsh"  # Container alias or full path
  precision: "fp8"  # fp4, fp8, fp16, bf16

# Resource allocation
resources:
  gpu_type: "gb200"  # gb200, h100 (used for GPU-specific optimizations)

  # Disaggregated mode: separate prefill and decode workers
  prefill_nodes: 1     # Number of nodes for prefill workers
  decode_nodes: 1      # Number of nodes for decode workers
  prefill_workers: 1   # Number of prefill worker processes
  decode_workers: 1    # Number of decode worker processes

  # Alternative: Aggregated mode 
  # agg_nodes: 4       # Total nodes for combined workers
  # agg_workers: 4     # Number of aggregated worker processes

  gpus_per_node: 4     # GPUs per node (typically 4 for GB200, 8 for H100)

# SLURM configuration (these override srtslurm.yaml defaults)

# Benchmark configuration

# Notes:
# - All SGLang flags are passed directly to the SGLang CLI (--flag-name value)
# - For full list of SGLang flags, see SGLang documentation
# - Use dry-run mode to preview generated commands: uv run srtctl dry-run -f example.yaml
# - Logs saved to: logs/{JOB_ID}_{WORKERS}_{TIMESTAMP}/
